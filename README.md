# ISS resources
This repo contains everything for passing the classes, as well as much more detailed explanations of concepts that I could not recall of the top of my head / didn't have time to go over. 

If something is crossed out, it will be added in some time, when/if it becomes relevant.

## Table of contents
### Project templates
I encourage you to use these as a starting point for the projects.
* [p1_communication_protocol.ino]()
* [p2_line_follower.ino]()
* ~~p3_ball_balancer.ino~~

More samples will be added when I confirm that we will actually be doing those projects.

### General examples
* [TRSensorsExample.ino](./TRSensorsExample.ino) - front bumper sensors for the mobile robot
* [motors.ino]() - Communicating with the motors
* ~~sonar.ino~~

### Everything else
Code written in class, and other miscellaneous code is in the [misc/](./misc/) directory.<br/>
[printf_fix.ino]() - code to fix the `printf` function. __*Not needed for the classes*__. Please seriously, this is for your convenience only.
