# ISS resources
This repo contains everything for passing the classes, as well as much more detailed explanations of concepts that I could not recall of the top of my head / didn't have time to go over. 

If something is crossed out, it will be added in some time, when/if it becomes relevant.

## Table of contents
### Project templates
I encourage you to use these as a starting point for the projects.
* [p1_communication_protocol.ino](./p1_communication_protocol.ino)
* [p2_line_follower.ino](./p2_line_follower.ino)
* ~~p3_ball_balancer.ino~~

More samples will be added when I confirm that we will actually be doing those projects.

### General examples
* [TRSensorsExample.ino](./TRSensorsExample.ino) - Front bumper sensor array.
* [motors.ino](./motors.ino) - Communicating with the motors.
* [regular_function_calls.ino](./regular_function_calls.ino) - Executing functions at regular intervals without halting the whole programme.
* ~~sonar.ino~~

### Everything else
Code written in class, and other miscellaneous code is in the [misc/](./misc/) directory.<br/>
[printf_fix.ino](./misc/printf_fix.ino) - code to fix the `printf` function. __*Not needed for the classes*__. Please seriously, this is for your convenience only.
